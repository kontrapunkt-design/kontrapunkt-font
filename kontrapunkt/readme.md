# Kontrapunkt

The typeface Kontrapunkt is based on a so called Egyptienne or slab serif. The style is characteristic through its square and significant serifs.

Every character in the alphabet of Kontrapunkt is intended to be a sort of sculpture in its own right - with characteristic details uniting the softness and the hardness. However, set in small sizes it is easy to read and seems almost like a sans serif.
